# FilenameSearcher

## This project is created using Rust. It is a searcher, that searches for a file in all directories, going from a root directory. It checks if the directory contains a .git file and then looks for the file needed.

# To use:
* If you want to compile the binaries yourself, Rust is required: https://www.rust-lang.org
* Pre compiled binaries can be found in the target/debug directory
* These binaries *only* work on windows machines! If you want to compile them to macOS / Linux, you need Rust installed and need to compile to that target. For more refer to: https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/cross-compilation.html

Have fun with this little project :) Hope it is helpful
